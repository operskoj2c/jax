These are the release notes for JAX.


jax 0.1.60 (unreleased)
-----------------------

.. PLEASE REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE '..master' WITH AN ACTUAL TAG in GITHUB LINK.

* `GitHub commits <https://github.com/google/jax/compare/jax-v0.1.59...master>`_.
* New features:

  * :py:func:`jax.pmap` has ``static_broadcast_argnums`` argument which allows
    the user to specify arguments that should be treated as compile-time
    constants and should be broadcasted to all devices. It works analogously to
    ``static_argnums`` in :py:func:`jax.jit`.
  * Improved error messages for when tracers are mistakenly saved in global state.
  * Added :py:func:`jax.nn.one_hot` utility function.
  * Added :py:module:`jax.experimental.jet` for exponentially faster
    higher-order automatic differentiation.
  * Added more sanity checking to arguments of :py:func:`jax.lax.broadcast_in_dim`.

* The minimum jaxlib version is now 0.1.41.

jaxlib 0.1.40 (March 4, 2020)
-------------------------------

* Adds experimental support in Jaxlib for TensorFlow profiler, which allows
  tracing of CPU and GPU computations from TensorBoard.
* Includes prototype support for multihost GPU computations that communicate via
  NCCL.
* Improves performance of NCCL collectives on GPU.
* Adds TopK, CustomCallWithoutLayout, CustomCallWithLayout, IGammaGradA and
  RandomGamma implementations.
* Supports device assignments known at XLA compilation time.

jax 0.1.59 (February 11, 2020)
------------------------------

* `GitHub commits <https://github.com/google/jax/compare/jax-v0.1.58...jax-v0.1.59>`_.
* Breaking changes

  * The minimum jaxlib version is now 0.1.38.
  * Simplified :py:class:`Jaxpr` by removing the ``Jaxpr.freevars`` and
    ``Jaxpr.bound_subjaxprs``. The call primitives (``xla_call``, ``xla_pmap``,
    ``sharded_call``, and ``remat_call``) get a new parameter ``call_jaxpr`` with a
    fully-closed (no ``constvars``) JAXPR. Also, added a new field ``call_primitive``
    to primitives.
* New features:

  * Reverse-mode automatic differentiation (e.g. ``grad``) of ``lax.cond``, making it
    now differentiable in both modes (https://github.com/google/jax/pull/2091)
  * JAX now supports DLPack, which allows sharing CPU and GPU arrays in a
    zero-copy way with other libraries, such as PyTorch.
  * JAX GPU DeviceArrays now support ``__cuda_array_interface__``, which is another
    zero-copy protocol for sharing GPU arrays with other libraries such as CuPy
    and Numba.
  * JAX CPU device buffers now implement the Python buffer protocol, which allows
    zero-copy buffer sharing between JAX and NumPy.
  * Added JAX_SKIP_SLOW_TESTS environment variable to skip tests known as slow.

jaxlib 0.1.39 (February 11, 2020)
--------------------------------

* Updates XLA.


jaxlib 0.1.38 (January 29, 2020)
--------------------------------

* CUDA 9.0 is no longer supported.
* CUDA 10.2 wheels are now built by default.

jax 0.1.58 (January 28, 2020)
-----------------------------

* `GitHub commits <https://github.com/google/jax/compare/46014da21...jax-v0.1.58>`_.
* Breaking changes

  * JAX has dropped Python 2 support, because Python 2 reached its end of life on
    January 1, 2020. Please update to Python 3.5 or newer.
* New features

    * Forward-mode automatic differentiation (`jvp`) of while loop
      (https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1980)
    * New NumPy and SciPy functions:

      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.fft2`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.ifft2`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.rfft`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.irfft`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.rfft2`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.irfft2`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.rfftn`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.irfftn`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.fftfreq`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.fft.rfftfreq`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.linalg.matrix_rank`
      * :py:func:`jax.numpy.linalg.matrix_power`
      * :py:func:`jax.scipy.special.betainc`
    * Batched Cholesky decomposition on GPU now uses a more efficient batched
      kernel.


Notable bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* With the Python 3 upgrade, JAX no longer depends on ``fastcache``, which should
  help with installation.
