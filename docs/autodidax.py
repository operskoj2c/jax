# # Autodidax: JAX core from scratch
#
# Ever want to learn how JAX works, but the implementation seemed too
# impenetrable? Well, you're in luck! By reading this tutorial, you'll learn
# every big idea in JAX's core system. You'll even get clued into our weird
# jargon!

# ## Part 1: Transformations as interpreters: standard evaluation, `jvp`, and `vmap`
#
# We want to transform functions that look like this:
#
# ```python
# def f(x):
#   y = sin(x) * 2
#   z = - y + x
#   return z
# ```
#
# Think of functions like `sin` and the arithmetic operations underlying the
# infix operators (`mul`, `add`, and `neg`) as primitive operations, meaning
# atomic units of processing rather than compositions.
#
# "Transform" means "interpret differently." Instead of standard interpretation
# where we apply primitive functions to numerical inputs to produce numerical
# outputs, we want to override primitive application and let different values
# flow through our program. For example, we might want to replace the
# application of every primitive with an application of [its JVP
# rule](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html),
# and let primal-tangent pairs flow through our program. Moreover, we want to
# apply a composition of multiple transformations, leading to stacks of
# interpreters.

# ### JAX core machinery
#
# We can implement stacks of interpreters and even have them all discharge on
# the fly as we execute the Python function to be transformed. To start, let's
# define these primitives so that we can intercept their application:


# +
from typing import NamedTuple

class Primitive(NamedTuple):
  name: str

add_p = Primitive('add')
mul_p = Primitive('mul')
neg_p = Primitive("neg")
sin_p = Primitive("sin")
cos_p = Primitive("cos")
reduce_sum_p = Primitive("reduce_sum")
greater_p = Primitive("greater")

def add(x, y): return bind(add_p, x, y)
def mul(x, y): return bind(mul_p, x, y)
def neg(x): return bind(neg_p, x)
def sin(x): return bind(sin_p, x)
def cos(x): return bind(cos_p, x)
def reduce_sum(x, axis=None): return bind(reduce_sum_p, x, axis=axis)
def greater(x, y): return bind(greater_p, x, y)


# -

# We'll set up array data types and infix operator methods in a moment.
#
# A `Primitive` is just an object with a name, to which we attach our
# interpretation rules (one for each transformation). The `bind` function is our
# interception point: it'll figure out which transformation rule to apply, based
# on how the arguments are boxed in tracers and what interpreters are active.
#
# The functions that user code calls, like `add` and `sin`, are just wrappers
# around calls to `bind`. These wrappers let us control how arguments are passed
# to `bind`, and in particular we follow a handy internal convention: when we
# call `bind`, we pass values representing array data as positional arguments,
# and we pass metadata like the `axis` argument to `sum_p` via keyword. This
# calling convention simplifies some core logic (since e.g. instances of the
# `Tracer` class to be defined below can only occurr in positional arguments to
# `bind`). The wrappers can also provide docstrings!
#
# We represent active interpreters as a stack. The stack is just a simple
# `list`, and each element is a container with an integer level (corresponding
# to the element's height in the stack), an interpreter type (which we'll call a
# `trace_type`), and an optional field for any global data the interpreter
# needs. We call each element a `MainTrace`, though maybe "Interpreter" would be
# more descriptive.

# +
from contextlib import contextmanager
from typing import Type, List, Optional, Any

class MainTrace(NamedTuple):
  level: int
  trace_type: Type['Trace']
  global_data: Optional[Any]

trace_stack: List[MainTrace] = []

@contextmanager
def new_main(trace_type: Type['Trace'], global_data=None):
  level = len(trace_stack)
  main = MainTrace(level, trace_type, global_data)
  trace_stack.append(main)

  try:
    yield main
  finally:
    trace_stack.pop()


# -

# When we're about to apply a transformed function, we'll push another
# interpreter onto the stack using `new_main`. Then, as we apply primitives in
# the function, we can think of the `bind` first being interpreted by the trace
# at the top of the stack (i.e. with the highest level). If that first
# interpreter itself binds other primitives in its interpretation rule for the
# primitive, like how the JVP rule of `sin_p` might bind `cos_p` and `mul_p`,
# then those `bind` calls will be handled by the interpreter at the next level
# down.
#
# What goes at the bottom of the interpreter stack? At the bottom, we know all
# the transformation interpreters are finished, and we just want to do standard
# evaluation. So at the bottom we'll put an evaluation interpreter.
#
# Let's sketch out the interface for interpreters, which is based on the `Trace`
# and `Tracer` base classes. A `Tracer` represents a boxed-up value, perhaps
# carrying some extra context data used by the interpreter. A `Trace` handles
# boxing up vales into `Tracers` and also handles primitive application.

class Trace:
  main: MainTrace

  def __init__(self, main: MainTrace) -> None:
    self.main = main

  def pure(self, val): assert False  # must override
  def lift(self, val): assert False  # must override

  def process_primitive(self, primitive, tracers, params):
    assert False  # must override


# The first two methods are about boxing up values in `Tracer`s, which are the
# objects that flow through the Python programs we transform. The last method is
# the callback we'll use to interpret primitive application.
#
# The `Trace` itself doesn't contain any data, other than a reference to its
# corresponding `MainTrace` instance. In fact, multiple instances of a `Trace`
# might be created and discarded during an application of a transformation,
# whereas only a single `MainTrace` instance is created per application of a
# transformation.
#
# As for `Tracer`s themselves, each one carries an abstract value (and forwards
# infix operators to it), and the rest is up to the transformation. (The
# relationship between `Tracer`s and `AbstractValue`s is that there's one
# `Tracer` per transformation, and at least one `AbstractValue` per base type,
# like arrays.)

# -

# Notice that we actually have two `AbstractValue`s for arrays, representing
# different levels of abstraction. A `ShapedArray` represents the set of all
# possible arrays with a given shape and dtype. A `ConcreteArray` represents a
# singleton set consisting of a single array value.
#
# Now that we've set up the trace stack, the Trace/Tracer API for interpreters,
# and abstract values, we can come back to implement `bind`:

def bind(prim, *args, **params):
  top_trace = find_top_trace(args)
  tracers = [full_raise(top_trace, arg) for arg in args]
  out = top_trace.process_primitive(prim, tracers, params)
  return full_lower(out)


# The main action is that we call `find_top_trace` to figure out which
# interpreter should handle this primitive application as a function of the
# arguments and the active traces on the trace stack. We then call that top
# trace's `process_primitive` so that the trace can apply its interpretation
# rule. The calls to `full_raise` just ensure that the inputs are boxed in the
# top trace's `Tracer` instances, and the call to `full_lower` is an optional
# optimization so that we unbox values out of `Tracer`s as much as possible.

# +
from operator import attrgetter

  top_main = max((x._trace.main for x in xs if isinstance(x, Tracer)),
                 default=trace_stack[0], key=attrgetter('level'))
  return top_main.trace_type(top_main)


# -

# In words, `find_top_trace` returns the highest-level interpreter associated
# with the `Tracer`s on its inputs, and otherwise returns the interpreter at the
# bottom of the stack (which is always an evaluation trace, at least for now).
# This corresponds to JAX transformations mostly working by data dependence
# _except_ for the special bottom-of-the-stack interpreter, which interprets
# everything.

# +
def full_lower(val):

  else:  # val._trace.level == level

# -

# The logic in `full_raise` serves to box values into `Tracer`s for a particular
# `Trace`, calling different methods on the `Trace` based on context:
# `Trace.pure` is called on non-`Tracer` constants, and `Trace.lift` is called
# for values that are already `Tracer`s from a lower-level interpreter. These
# two methods could share the same implementation, but by distinguishing them in
# the core logic we can provide more information to the `Trace` subclass.
#
# That's it for the JAX core! Now we can start adding interpreters.

# ### Evaluation interpreter
#
# We'll start with the simplest interpreter: the evaluation interpreter that
# will sit at the bottom of the interpreter stack.

# +

# -

# With this interpreter, we can evaluate user functions:

# +
def f(x):
  y = sin(x) * 2
  z = - y + x
  return z

print(f(3.0))


# -

# Woo! Like going around in a big circle. But the point of this indirection is
# that now we can add some real transformations.

#
# First, a couple of helper functions:

# +

  out_primal = greater(x, y)
  return out_primal, zeros_like(out_primal)

# -

# Finally, we add a transformation API to kick off the trace:

def jvp(f, primals, tangents):
  with new_main(JVPTrace) as main:
    trace = JVPTrace(main)
    tracers_in = [JVPTracer(trace, x, t) for x, t in zip(primals, tangents)]

# And with that, we can differentiate!

# -

# ### Vectorized batching with `vmap`
#
# First, a couple helper functions, one for producing mapped abstract values
# from unmapped ones (by removing an axis), and one for moving batch dimensions

# That's it for `jvp` and `vmap`! Before moving on, let's highlight a few
# simplifications in what we've seen so far compared to the full JAX
# implementation:
# 1. **Fewer, simpler primitives.** More primitives means more interpretation
# rules, and for more complex primitives (like for convolution or advanced
# indexing) each rule is harder to write. But the overarching design is no
# different.
# 1. **Transformations expect arrays in, single array out.**
# 2. **No symbolic zeros in autodiff.**
# 3. **No special call primitives yet.** The core machinery needs to be
#     generalized to handle the most flexible kind of higher-order primitive,
#     used by `jax.custom_jvp` and `jax.custom_vjp`.

# ## Part 2: Jaxprs, for `jit` and `vjp`
#
# The next transformations are the horizon are `jit` for just-in-time
# compilation and `vjp` for reverse-mode autodiff.  (`grad` is just a small
# wrapper around `vjp`.) For `jvp` and `vmap` we only needed each `Tracer` to
# carry a little    bit of extra context, but for both `jit` and `vjp` we need
# much richer context: we need to represent _programs_. That is, we need jaxprs!
#
# Jaxprs are JAX's internal intermediate representation of programs. Jaxprs are
# an explicitly typed, functional, first-order language. We need a program
# representation for `jit` because the purpose of `jit` is to stage computation
# out of Python. For any computation we want to stage out, we need to be able to
# represent it as data, and build it up as we trace a Python function.
# Similarly, `vjp` needs a way to represent the computation for the backward
# pass of reverse-mode autodiff. We use the same jaxpr program representation
# for both needs.
#
# (Building a program representation is the most
# [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_object) kind of
# trace- transformation, and so except for issues around handling native Python
# control flow, any transformation could be implemented by first tracing to a
# jaxpr and then interpreting the jaxpr.)
#
# The jaxpr term syntax is roughly:
#
# ```
# jaxpr ::=
#   { lambda <binder> , ... .
#     let <eqn>
#         ...
#     in <atom> }
#
# binder ::= <var>:<array_type>
# var ::= a | b | c | ...
# atom ::= <var> | <literal>
# literal ::= <int32> | <float32>
#
# eqn ::= <binder> = <primitive> [ <params> ] <atom> , ...
# ```
#
# The syntax of types is:
#
# ```
# jaxpr_type ::= [<array_type>, ...] -> [<array_type>, ...]
# array_type ::= <dtype>[<shape>]
# dtype ::= f32 | f64 | i32 | i64
# shape ::= <int> , ...

# Now that we have jaxprs as a data structure, we need ways to produce these
# from tracing Python code. In general there are two variants of how we trace to
# a jaxpr; `jit` uses one and `vjp` uses the other. We'll start with the one
# used   by `jit`, which is also used by control flow primitives like
# `lax.cond`, `lax.while_loop`, and `lax.scan`.
