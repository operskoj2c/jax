`jit` changes the behavior of my function
-----------------------------------------

If you have a Python function that changes behavior after using `jit`, perhaps
your function uses global state, or has side-effects. In the following code, the
`impure_func` uses the global `y` and has a side-effect due to `print`::

    y = 0

    # @jit   # Different behavior with jit
    def impure_func(x):
      print("Inside:", y)
      return x + y

    for y in range(3):
      print("Result:", impure_func(y))

Without `jit` the output is::

    Inside: 0
    Result: 0
    Inside: 1
    Result: 2
    Inside: 2
    Result: 4

and with `jit` it is:

    Inside: 0
    Result: 0
    Result: 1
    Result: 2

For `jit` the function is executed once using the Python interpreter, at which time the
`Inside` printing happens, and the first value of `y` is observed. Then the function
is compiled and cached, and executed multiple times with different values of `x`, but
with the same first value of `y`.

Gradients contain `NaN` where using ``where``
------------------------------------------------

If you define a function using ``where`` to avoid an undefined value, if you
are not careful you may obtain a `NaN` for reverse differentiation::

  def my_log(x):
    return np.where(x > 0., np.log(x), 0.)

  my_log(0.) ==> 0.  # Ok
  jax.grad(my_log)(0.)  ==> NaN

A short explanation is that during ``grad`` computation the adjoint corresponding
to the undefined ``np.log(x)`` is a ``NaN`` and when it gets accumulated to the
adjoint of the ``np.where``. The correct way to write such functions is to ensure
that there is a ``np.where`` *inside* the partially-defined function, to ensure
that the adjoint is always finite::

  def safe_for_grad_log(x):
    return np.log(np.where(x > 0., x, 1.)

  safe_for_grad_log(0.) ==> 0.  # Ok
  jax.grad(safe_for_grad_log)(0.)  ==> 0.  # Ok

The inner ``np.where`` may be needed in addition to the original one, e.g.:

  def my_log_or_y(x, y):
    """Return log(x) if x > 0 or y"""
    return np.where(x > 0., np.log(np.where(x > 0., x, 1.), y)
