## Updating the documentation

This file is automatically generated by running the jax2tf tests in
`jax/experimental/jax2tf/tests/primitives_test.py` and
`jax/experimental/jax2tf/tests/control_flow_ops_test.py` with the
`JAX2TF_OUTPUT_LIMITATIONS` environment variable set.

## Generated summary of primitives with limited support

The following JAX primitives are converted to Tensorflow but the result of the
conversion may trigger runtime errors when run on certain devices and with
certain data types. Note that some of these primitives have unimplemented
cases even for JAX, e.g., sort does not work for complex numbers on TPUs.
This table includes only those cases that **work** in JAX but **fail** after
conversion to Tensorflow.
